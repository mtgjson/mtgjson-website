# Contributing

The MTGJSON documentation website uses [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) Server-Side Generated website framework with some tricks of our own.

## Knowledge Requirements

- Node
- TypeScript
- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- Pinia
- VitePress
- Markdown
- JSON
- SCSS
- SEO
- Accessibility
- MTGJSON Files

## Technical Requirements

- Node
- npm
- n

## IDE Setup

The current preferred IDE is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Be sure the install the following extensions:

- Vue Language Features (Volar)
- Typescript Vue Plugin (Volar)

**Note:** You may have to enable "Takeover Mode" by disabling VS Code's builtin package `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features` within the workspace.

## VitePress Configuration

Explaining the configuration as a whole would be best served by directly linking to the [VitePress documentation](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/config/introduction.html).

## Markdown Files

### Use and Purpose

> **Use**: To serve has as static routing of the application.  
> **Purpose**: All markdown files should be named `index.md`. That file will act as the single `index.html` for a directory.

### Markdown Structure

The structure of a file is simple. Frontmatter on top, everything else below it. Some notes:

- Frontmatter is written in YAML.
- Markdown is written to a high-level of specification.
- Vue components can only be used in Markdown if they are registered globally via `./docs/vitepress/theme/index.ts`.

### Using Frontmatter

Frontmatter is configuration that begins each markdown file to define meta data for that "route". Such configuration is HTML Head data and Vue component data and state.

You can also change configuration of VitePress by overwriting variables within the frontmatter, such a title, description, etc.

> Remember: Frontmatter goes at the top of any Markdown file.

#### Example

```yaml
title: Card (Set)
enum: card
head:
  - - meta
    - property: og:title
      content: Card (Set)
  - - meta
    - name: description
      content: The Card (Set) Data Model describes the keys and calues of a single card in a set.
  - - meta
    - property: og:description
      content: The Card (Set) Data Model describes the properties of a single card in a set.
  - - meta
    - name: keywords
      content: mtg, magic the gathering, mtgjson, json, card, card set
```

### Markdown Syntax for Documentation Fields

#### Property Field

An example of a property field for a data object field in Markdown:

```
> ### artist <i class="optional"></i>
>
> The name of the artist that illustrated the card art.  
>
> **Type:** `string`
> **Introduced:** `v4.0.0`
```

The `<i class="optional"></i>` markup will render a UI change in the property that denotes the property is optional and also power a component that will allow toggling the UI to view or not view these fields.

You can also use the `<ExampleField type='<Enum Name>'` component to render examples provided the enum values exist in the EnumValues.json file. This requires some frontmatter updates where the `enum` Frontmatter property has a value that equates to an EnumValues.json property and the `<Enum Name>` is the property within that enumeration. For example:

If you set `enum` is Frontmatter to `card`, and `<Enum Name>` to `availability`, the example field will populate from `EnumValues.json` -> `data` -> `card` -> `availability`.

#### TypeScript Notations

Use the `<ModelType type='<Model Name>' />` component to render the TypeScript notation for a Data Model where `<Model Name>` is the Data Model, such as `CardAtomic` or `DeckList`.

#### Table of Contents

Include `[[toc]]` near the top of the page, like the other pages, to render out the property headers and use the `<PropertyToggler/>` component right above `[[toc]]` to enable toggling optional properties on the Table of Contents.

## Pinia Store

We use Pinia to fetch data from MTGJSON API's in order to fill our application data. However, we only do this during the first render so the application and store remains as performant as possible.

## Testing

We use Jest and try our best. Test runs before commits and will fail the commit if necessary.

## Pull Requests

We like to keep our history as clearly labeled as possible. Here are some examples of PR title formats we appreciate but are not strict about:

- `issue/123: Fixed bug`: "issue" is a branch which a PR handles something where an issue was opened
- `NS/documentation_updates: Updated README`: "NS" is a branch which a PR handles something with no open issue

Be sure to squash all commits and remove any commit messages that are unclear. Keep the commit title exact and concise.
