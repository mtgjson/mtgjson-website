# Brand Assets

When working on a project you may want to credit MTGJSON (It's not required, but we would like you to!). Below you can find some of assets to use in your projects to credit MTGJSON.

We currently do not have a style guide but please use what you can without altering the assets in any way.

<small>P.S. Working on a project that uses MTGJSON? Reach out to us and we'll add your project to our homepage!</small>
