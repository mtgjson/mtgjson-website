# Brand Assets

When working on your project, you may want to credit MTGJSON (It's not required, but we would like you to!). Below you can find some of our assets.

As of the moment, we only require you not to alter the assets and not to use them in a way that would indicate of imply MTGJSON endorses you or your project.

<small>P.S. Working on a project that uses MTGJSON? Reach out to us and we'll add your project to our homepage!</small>
