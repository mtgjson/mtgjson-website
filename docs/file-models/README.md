# File Models

The "Web API" or more commonly known as "files" that MTGJSON.com provides varies from JSON to compressed files to SQL databases. The following documentation describes the JSON-based files and how they are served. Compressed versions of these files have the same data inside of them.

::: tip While MTGJSON.com serves a variety of files, there are only a few major file types, and variations to those types, that utilize one or more data models:
</br>

- **AllPrintings**: Serves all set data using the [Set](/file-models/set/) file model.
- **AllIdentifiers**: Serves all card data using the [Card (Set)](../card-set/) data model.
- **AtomicCards**: Serves all card data using the [Card (Atomic)](/file-models/card-atomic) data model.
- **[Format]**: Serves variable set data using the [Set](/file-models/set/) file model.
- **[Format]Atomic**: Serves variable card data using [Card (Atomic)](/file-models/card-atomic/) data model.
- Other files serve specific data using data models such as the [Deck](/file-models/deck/), [All Prices](/abstract-models/all-prices/) or other abstract data models.
</br>
