### Announcements
<img src="/images/assets/logo-mtgjson-thumbnail.png" style="max-height: 100px; float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" alt="New MTGJSON Logo"/>We are proud to announce the 5th major release of MTGJSON! The team has made big improvements including a new “API” endpoint to serve files. We have also given our documentation an overhaul - including upgrading our server to run on Nginx.

We are also pleased to announce the addition of `Booster` information on the `Set` data model. For more information, see the documentation for [Booster](/abstract-models/booster) data model.
