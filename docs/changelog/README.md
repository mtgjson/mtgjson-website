## 4.6.0
Release Date: 2019-10-28

### Announcements
<img src="/images/assets/logo-mtgjson-thumbnail.png" style="max-height: 100px; float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" alt="New MTGJSON Logo"/>Since the release of MTJSON v4.5.0, we've been working hard on bringing more and more data for our users. Today, we are pleased to announce several awesome changes coming to the project.

First, this release is the first of many releases to be compiled on AWS infrastructure. Thanks to the kind folks who have and continue to pledge on our [Patreon page](https://patreon.com/mtgjson), we are able to offer **daily builds of MTGJSON**! For the time being, we only plan on building price data daily, but we plan on expanding that further to full data releases as well.

Speaking of pricing, we now have MTGO pricing available thanks to our friends at [CardHoarder](https://www.cardhoarder.com/?affiliate_id=mtgjson&utm_source=mtgjson&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card)! This expands our lineup to supporting both paper and digital, with foil and non-foil variants. With the increase of price data available, we have made the decision to separate price data from card data. Price data can now be found within `AllPrices.json` (and compressed versions), indexable via [MTGJSON UUIDs](https://mtgjson.com/structures/card/#uuid). We hope these daily price updates will help keep your projects on top of the world.

Next, in order to alleviate a large percentage of confusion with our project, we have renamed `AllSets` to `AllPrintings`, with better descriptions and upgraded site layouts. Redirects will be in place to ensure current projects do not suffer due to this change.

Finally, we have several new compiled download-ables available. You can find more information on that down below. We now support JSON, SQL, SQLite, and CSV downloads of many components. With this change, we have renamed our `/json/<filename>` endpoint to `/files/<filename>`. More information found below.

As we've said before, and will continue to reiterate: The future looks bright for MTGJSON and we would like to thank the community for its continued support and we look forward to serving you well.

### Cards
#### Added
- Digital Pricing, courtesy of CardHoarder!
	- `prices[mtgo]` and `prices[mtgoFoil]`

- `prices` map will only contain one entry for each field, maximum
	- Full price data can be found in the new `AllPrices` file :)

### Announcements
<img src="/images/mit-license.jpg" style="max-height: 100px; float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" alt="MIT License"/>With the 4.4.2 release of MTGJSON, we have officially changed licenses for our project. From this point onward, all code and content are available under the MIT license. We felt that GPLv3 was a bit too restrictive for what we aim to achieve: free, open data for all who have an interest in Magic: the Gathering and development. We look forward to serving our users and cannot wait to see what you can create!<br/><br/>

### Announcements
<a href="https://patreon.com/mtgjson" target="_blank"><img src="/images/icon-patreon.svg" style="max-height: 100px; float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" alt="MTGJSON"/></a> MTGJSON has long been a free and open-sourced project made for the community, by the community. As time has gone on, our financial situation have unfortunately changed and we are looking for your help. While MTGJSON will continue to be a free service forever, the development team has put together a few small perks for those who would like to help support continued and active development of the project, whether it be via code contributions or financial support. If you have benefited from the MTGJSON project in the past and can spare a few dollars a month, we have launched a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mtgjson) to help cover the costs of development and upkeep. You can see [our current supporters](https://mtgjson.com/#patreon-supporters) on the homepage. We look forward to actively serving the community well and thank you for your support!<br/><br/>

<a href="https://www.mtgstocks.com/news?utm_campaign=mtgjson&utm_medium=mtgjson&utm_source=mtgjson" target="_blank"><img src="/images/avatar-mtgstocks.jpg" style="max-height: 100px; float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" alt="MTGStocks"/></a> MTGJSON strives to provide our users with the most accurate and complete data possible. As such, we are always looking for new sources to enrich our content. One of the most requested additions to our data was card price history, as there are a large number of analyses that can be run with such data.

As of today, I am pleased to announce that MTGJSON and [MTGStocks](https://www.mtgstocks.com/news?utm_campaign=mtgjson&utm_medium=mtgjson&utm_source=mtgjson) have formed a partnership to bring historic paper pricing data to our users. With the 4.4.0 release, you can access pricing data for any individual card in weekly intervals for the past three months (12 entries). We hope to continue bringing you, our users, the most complete data possible to create the best content.

MTGJSON will be updating on a weekly basis, usually Sundays, with updated card prices. You can confirm the changes via the new meta tag, `pricesDate`, which will update whenever new prices go live.

If you have data you believe would be relevant to MTGJSON and the development community, please feel free to reach out via [zach@mtgjson.com](mailto:zach@mtgjson.com)

- Fixed Unstable booster content

#### Added

## 4.2.0
Release Date: 2018-12-18

### Individual Sets
#### Changed
- `baseSetSize` numbers have been adjusted because of new `isAlternative` field

- `duelDeck` used to denote which deck of a duel deck product (`a` or `b`)

#### Changed
- UUIDs have been changed: the old field has become `scryfallId` whereas the new field is now `uuid` (these have reverted back to before 4.1.3, they are no longer modified, and are once again exactly 36 characters); keep in mind a UUID for each face on the same physical card is not unique
- `uuid` is now manually generated as a UUID v5 based on card attributes (name, set code, colors, Scryfall UUIDv4, printed text) and token attributes (name, colors, power, toughness, setcode, Scryfall UUIDv4); a UUID for each face is unique
- `variations` field uses the MTGJSON generated `uuid` field (not the `scryfallId` field, like it did before)
- Some entries updated in the `names` array of cards

- TCGPlayer API information

#### Changed
- Fixed more tokens that were appearing in `names` and `cards` arrays
- Meld cards now assign the values “a”, “b”, and “c” to the `side` field, where “a” and “b” are for the two front sides and “c” is the meld back sides
- UUIDs for split cards, meld cards, and split tokens are 37 characters in length (with the first 36 characters being the same between them)

## 4.1.2
Release Date: 2018-11-30

### Individual Cards
#### Added
- Cards with variants not in _Un_-sets now use `variations` instead of different names (an array of UUIDs containing the other printings of the same card in the set) — for exampl, the card “Cursed Scroll” from World Championship Decks 1999 with the UUID `51694451-d762-4c22-b9a1-61ce4716826b` has these variations:

```json
"variations": [
