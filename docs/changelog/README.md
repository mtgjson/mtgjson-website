#### Added

- Re-added variations printings (mainly in `ARN`)

- Updated watermarks for cards that had `set` as the watermark.
  - Example: `Blood Moon` in `A25` will now have a watermark of `set (DRK)` rather than `set`

## 4.3.1 <small>(2019-03-04)</small>

### Website

- Minor layout modifications to the splash page for improved user experience
- Latest version number now shown in the upper left hand corner

- `scryfallIllustrationId` can be used as a UUID for unique artwork - See [documentation](/structures/card) for more information

#### Changed

- `baseSetSize` defaults to `totalSetSize` if not manually adjusted - Found an error in the value? Provide a correction [on GitHub](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson/blob/master/mtgjson4/resources/base_set_sizes.json)

  - Please let us know what you think via email or Discord, always looking to improve :)
- We also have a new logo!

### Compiled Outputs

#### Added

- `CompiledList` which contains a list of all compiled outputs
- `Keywords` now has `abilityWords`, `keywordActions`, and `keywordAbilities`
  - `AbilityWords`, `KeywordActions`, and `KeywordAbilities` are deprecated and will be removed in 4.4.0
- `CardTypes` is now a compiled output, which gives all possible super/subtypes of each card type
- `AllDeckFiles` has been added and contains archives of all decks (read below)

#### Changed

- `AllSetsNoUn` is now `Vintage`. System rewrite rules have been added to keep compatibility
- `SetList` now has field `type` to indicate the type of set it stands for
- `SetList` now has field `parentCode` to indicate if the set is a child of a parent
- `Keywords` now has a meta tag

#### Removed

- `AllCardsNoUn` has been removed due to lack of use and purpose. Try `AllCards` for your card needs
- `AllCards` has lost `duelDeck`, `frameEffect`, `isStarter`, `isTimeshifted`, and `scryfallId` as these fields are not atomic

### Pre-constructed Decks

#### Added

- Precons have arrived! Simply check out [/json/decks](/json/decks) for the options

### Individual Sets

#### Added

- `parentCode` which is given to sets that are a child of another set
  - Mainly related to promo sets

### Individual Cards

#### Added

- `uuidV421` is a holdover field to help developers assimilate to the new `uuid` field. This will be removed in 4.4.0

#### Changed

- `starter` is now `isStarter`, as alerted to in prior releases
- `uuid` is _finally_ finalized. You can use `uuidV421` to get the 4.2.1 UUID to help assimilate to the new UUID
  - This is the final version. No more change should come to UUID. We apologize for so many changes over time

#### Fixed

- `foreignData` is now more accurate
- Some fields on tokens were mistakenly left blank. This has been addressed

## 4.2.2 <small>(2019-01-30)</small>

### Individual Sets

#### Added

- Ravnica Guild Kit (`GK2`)

#### Changed

- 2018 Gift Pack set code changed from `PGP18` or `PGP1` to `G18`
- 2017 Gift Pack set code changed from `PGP17` to `G17`

### Individual Cards

#### Changed

- Updated rules and oracle text wording corrections
- Updated missing foreign data for newer cards

### Other

#### Added

- Old School (`oldschool`) is now a supported format

## 4.2.1 <small>(2019-01-12)</small>

### Individual Sets

#### Changed

- `code` is now capitalized
- **NOTE: UUIDs have changed due to `code` being capitalized. This is _hopefully_ the last time we will break UUIDs <3**
- `mtgoCode` is now capitalized
- Fixed Unstable booster content

#### Added

- `codeV3` for the few sets who have different Gatherer codes

### Individual Cards

#### Changed

- `rarity` no longer contains things like "timeshifted rare" as that can be inferred (this reverts a 4.1.1 change)
- Fixed several cards having incorrect data

#### Added

- `life` for Vanguard cards
- `hand` for Vanguard cards
- `tcgplayerProductId` used to identify the card on TCGPlayer’s website
- `tcgplayerPurchaseUrl` which contains URLs to purchase cards ( referrals are nice :) )

### Other

#### Added

- MTGJSON has a new logo (please do give feedback!)
- `AllSetFiles.zip`, which contains all individual set files in a folder instead of `AllSets.json` (which is one file with all of the data)

## 4.2 <small>(2018-12-18)</small>

### Individual Sets

#### Changed

- `baseSetSize` numbers have been adjusted because of new `isAlternative` field

### Individual Cards

#### Added

- `isAlternative` used for cards that are a secret foil (in select sets)
- `duelDeck` used to denote which deck of a duel deck product (`a` or `b`)
- `frameEffect` used for cards with added frame styling

#### Changed

- UUIDs have been changed: the old field has become `scryfallId` whereas the new field is now `uuid` (these have reverted back to before 4.1.3, they are no longer modified, and are once again exactly 36 characters); keep in mind a UUID for each face on the same physical card is not unique
- `uuid` is now manually generated as a UUID v5 based on card attributes (name, set code, colors, Scryfall UUIDv4, printed text) and token attributes (name, colors, power, toughness, setcode, Scryfall UUIDv4); a UUID for each face is unique
- `variations` field uses the MTGJSON generated `uuid` field (not the `scryfallId` field, like it did before)
- Some entries updated in the `names` array of cards
- Fixed meld card ordering with Chittering Host and company
- Fixed duplicate tokens appearing in `tokens` array with missing attributes

### Other

#### Added

- MTGJSON commands have been updated and simplified (see README for more details)

#### Changed

- `Keywords.json` abilities are now in lowercase

#### Removed

- Removed `SetCodes.json` (same information can be found in `SetLists.json`)

## 4.1.3 <small>(2018-12-07)</small>

### Individual Sets

#### Added

- Compiled outputs now avaiable for different formats, including `AllCardsNoUn.json`, `AllSetsNoUn.json`, `Standard.json`, and `Modern.json`
- New formats available for set downloads: `.gz`, `.bz2`, `.xz`

### Individual Cards

#### Added

- TCGPlayer API information

#### Changed

- Fixed more tokens that were appearing in `names` and `cards` arrays
- Meld cards now assign the values “a”, “b”, and “c” to the `side` field, where “a” and “b” are for the two front sides and “c” is the meld back sides
- UUIDs for split cards, meld cards, and split tokens are 37 characters in length (with the first 36 characters being the same between them)

## 4.1.2 <small>(2018-11-30)</small>

### Individual Cards

#### Added

- Cards with variants not in _Un_-sets now use `variations` instead of different names (an array of UUIDs containing the other printings of the same card in the set) — for exampl, the card “Cursed Scroll” from World Championship Decks 1999 with the UUID `51694451-d762-4c22-b9a1-61ce4716826b` has these variations:

```json
"variations": [
  "226007db-4cd2-43ec-9f2c-4e68fff7d960",
  "42f64a71-5c4c-45b3-9963-880768b2343b",
  "0b23cdc8-d413-4fb1-8470-474221b10fe2"
]
```

#### Changed

- Cards with variants in _Un_-sets now no longer include names with `(a)` in `name` — for example:
  - `Very Cryptic Command`
  - `Very Cryptic Command (b)`
  - `Very Cryptic Command (c)`
  - `Very Cryptic Command (d)`
  - `Very Cryptic Command (e)`
  - `Very Cryptic Command (f)`

### Individual Cards

- Cards with multiple printings in a single set now have `a`, `b` after name
- Better parsing of `colors` on cards

- Address UUID collisions

### Other

#### Changed

- Updated sets download page with _all_ sets we build
- Reordered sets download page to have newest at top
- `version.json` now exists to inform of latest release: - This is manual for right now, will be automated soon
