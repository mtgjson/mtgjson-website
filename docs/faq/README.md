# Frequently Asked Questions

Here is a list of frequently asked questions from our users since some data can be nuanced.

[[toc]]

### Which file should I use for my project?
::: tip Which file should I use for my project?
In most cases, [AllPrintings.json](/api/v5/AllPrintings.json.zip) is the correct file. It contains all data for every printing of each card. Alternatively you can browse the per-set json files or download database images.

Note that the json files are minified, and not really human-readable: use a software like JQ to parse and process them.

### Which file formats should I use for my project?
::: tip Which file formats should I use for my project?
We recommend downloaded the compressed copies of files and unpack locally, as it will almost certainly be faster than downloading the full sized .json files.

### Where does the data come from?
::: tip Where does the data come from?
Data is collected from a variety of sources, including Gatherer, Scryfall, TCGPlayer, and many more. If you want to know more, or you would like to help, jump on our [Discord](https://mtgjson.com/discord)!

### What is the best way to download the data?
::: tip What is the best way to download the data?
We recommend downloading the compressed files and unpacking them on your local/remote drive. This is be faster than downloading just the pure JSON files.

::: tip How can I help? Where can I report a bug suggestion etc?
You can contribute to the project through the main [MTGJSON repo](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson) or the [MTGJSON website repo](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson-website). If you are a data provider and would like to integrate your data with us, please join our [Discord](https://mtgjson.com/discord).

### How often is the data updated?
::: tip How often is the data updated?
Full builds are available weekly at <strong style="color: var(--accent-color);">Tuesday, 12:01AM ET</strong>, but prices are available daily at <strong style="color: var(--accent-color);">12:01AM ET</strong>. Also, when a new set is being previewed, that set will be rebuilt daily until the set is released.

### Can I verify the downloaded files?
::: tip Can I verify the downloaded files?
Yes. Every file has a SHA-256 file available at the same API location with an appended `.sha256` format.

For example: `https://mtgjson.com/api/v5/AllPrintings.json.sha256`

### How do I access a card's imagery?
::: tip How do I access a card's imagery?
While we do not offer card images directly through MTGJSON, we recommend getting card images through Scryfall or Gatherer API's using the MTGJSON a property from the [Identifiers](../data-models/identifiers) data model within the [Card](../data-models/card) data model.

<strong>Scryfall:</strong> `https://api.scryfall.com/cards/${card.identifiers.scryfallId}?format=image`  
<Strong>Gatherer:</strong> `https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=${card.identifiers.multiverseId}`  

Note: Gatherer may not have all images. If a `multiverseId` is missing, the imagery will not exist there.
:::

### How do I find the other card faces of "Meld" cards?
::: tip How do I find the other card faces of "Meld" cards?
The most effective way to get the other cards for "Meld" cards is to access the `otherFaceIds` property of any of the "Meld" cards. This property will return two `uuid` values for the other associated cards.

Depending on your use case, this can be enough data to get the information you need, otherwise you can use those cards to access their `otherFaceIds` to get the card you need by comparing the data that you have already.
:::

### What information is in AtomicCards.json?
::: tip What information is in AtomicCards.json?
[AtomicCards.json](/api/v5/AtomicCards.json.zip) only contains oracle information for each card. Any data that is persistent across the printings of a card will be included, such as `convertedManaCost`, but anything that pertains to a specific printing of a card will **NOT** be included, such as `artist`.

For a full list of properties, see the [Card (Atomic)](/data-models/card-atomic/) data model documentation. Note that depending on your use case you probably do not need this file, as it can be easily derived from `AllPrintings.json` - handle with care.
:::

### Why is the file I just downloaded out of date?
::: tip Why is the file I just downloaded out of date?
You have probably received a cached version of the file. Try hard refreshing the website (`CTRL + F5` on Windows, `Shift + Command + R` on Mac) and re-downloading to get the newest version.
