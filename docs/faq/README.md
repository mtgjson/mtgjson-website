# Frequently Asked Questions

Here is a list of frequently asked questions from our users since some data can be nuanced.

[[toc]]

> ### Which file should I use for my project?
> In most cases, [AllPrintings](/downloads/all-files/#allprintings) is the correct file. It contains all data for every printing of each card organized by set, however, this file is quite large. Alternatively, you can browse the [All Sets](/downloads/all-sets/) and [All Decks](/downloads/all-decks/) files or even download [Databases](/downloads/all-files/#allprintings).
>
> **Note:** The JSON files are minified, and not human-readable. Depending on your implementation, you can use a software like [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to parse and process them.

> ### Which file formats should I use for my project?
> We recommend downloading the compressed files and unpacking them on your local/remote drive. This would be faster than downloading the JSON files.

> ### Where does the data come from?
> Data is collected from a variety of sources, including Magic: The Gathering's own [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx), API's like [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) and [TCGplayer](https://docs.tcgplayer.com/docs), and many more. For more information, or if you would like to help, please join our [Discord](https://mtgjson.com/discord)!

> ### How much does MTGJSON cost?

> ### How can I help, report a bug, etc?
> You can contribute to the project through the main [MTGJSON repo](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson) or the [MTGJSON website repo](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson-website). If you are a data provider and would like to integrate your data with us, please join our [Discord](https://mtgjson.com/discord).

> ### How often is the data updated?
> Builds kick off at **3:00PM ET** taking between 4-5 hours to complete and go live at **9:00PM ET**.

> ### Can I verify the downloaded files?
> Yes. Every file has a SHA-256 file available at the same URL location appended with `.sha256`.
>
> - **Example:** `https://mtgjson.com/api/v5/AllPrintings.json.sha256`

> ### How do I access a card's imagery?
> While we do not offer card images directly through MTGJSON, we recommend getting card images through [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) or [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/) using the MTGJSON property from the [Identifiers](/data-models/identifiers/) Data Model within the various Card Data Models.
>
> - **Scryfall:** `https://api.scryfall.com/cards/${scryfallId}?format=image`
> - **Gatherer:** `https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=${multiverseId}`
>
> - **Note:**
> [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/) may not have all images. If a `multiverseId` is missing, the imagery will not exist there.
> For [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/), to access another face of a card, such as `"transform"` or `"meld"` cards, add `&face=front` or `&face=back` to the url to get the respective image.

> ### How can I access a card's set imagery?
> The `keyruneCode` property from the [Set](/data-models/set/) Data Model provides information you need for implementing set code imagery but is mostly limited to projects that can use CSS, however, there is ways to use them in desktop applications. See the [Keyrune official documentation](https://keyrune.andrewgioia.com/) for more information.
>
> Additionally, you can use [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/) for a limited amount of set printings using the following Gatherer API.  
>
> **Example**: `https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=symbol&set=${setCode}&rarity=${rarity}&size=large`  
>
> In this case, `rarity` is just the starting letter of the rarity, such as `m`, `r`, `u`, or `c`.

> ### How do I find the other card faces of "Meld" cards?
> The most effective way to get the other cards for "Meld" cards is to access the `otherFaceIds` property of any of the "Meld" cards. This property will return two `uuid` values for the other associated cards.
>
> **Note:** Depending on your use case, this can be enough data to get the information you need, otherwise you can use those cards to access their `otherFaceIds` to get the card you need by comparing the data that you have already.

> ### What information is in AtomicCards or similar files?
> These files contains oracle-like information for every card using the [Card (Atomic)](/data-models/card-atomic/) Data Model. Any data that is persistent across the printings of a card will be included, such as `colorIdentity`, but anything that pertains to a specific printing of a card will **NOT** be included, such as `artist`.
>
> For a full list of properties, see the [Card (Atomic)](/data-models/card-atomic/) Data Model documentation.
>
> **Note:** Depending on your use case you probably do not need this file, as it can be easily derived from [AllPrintings](/downloads/all-files/#allprintings) - handle with care.

> ### Why is a file/website out of date?
> You have probably received a cached version of the file or website. If you are using the website or have a file open in the browser, try hard&#8209;refreshing the url (`CTRL + F5` on Windows, `Shift + Command + R` on MacOS).
