# Frequently Asked Questions

Here is a list of frequently asked questions from our users since some data can be nuanced.

[[toc]]

> ### Which file should I use for my project?
> In most cases, [AllPrintings](/downloads/all-files/#allprintings) is the correct file. It contains all data for every printing of each card organized by set. Alternatively you can browse the per-set json files or download database images.
>
> Note that the json files are minified, and not really human-readable: use a software like [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to parse and process them.

> ### Which file formats should I use for my project?
> We recommend downloading the compressed files and unpacking them on your local/remote drive. This is be faster than downloading just the pure JSON files.

> ### Where does the data come from?
> Data is collected from a variety of sources, including Gatherer, Scryfall, TCGplayer, and many more. If you want to know more, or you would like to help, jump on our [Discord](https://mtgjson.com/discord)!

> ### How much does MTGJSON cost?
> MTGJSON is free and open source under the MIT License.

> ### How can I help, report a bug, etc?
> You can contribute to the project through the main [MTGJSON repo](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson) or the [MTGJSON website repo](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson-website). If you are a data provider and would like to integrate your data with us, please join our [Discord](https://mtgjson.com/discord).

> ### How often is the data updated?
> Full builds are available weekly at **Tuesday, 12:01AM ET**, but prices are available daily at **12:01AM ET**. Also, when a new set is being previewed, that set will be rebuilt daily until the set is released.

> ### Can I verify the downloaded files?
> Yes. Every file has a SHA-256 file available at the same API location with an appended `.sha256` format.
> 
> - **Example:** `https://mtgjson.com/api/v5/AllPrintings.json.sha256`

> ### How do I access a card's imagery?
> While we do not offer card images directly through MTGJSON, we recommend getting card images through Scryfall or Gatherer API's using the MTGJSON a property from the [Identifiers](../data-models/identifiers) data model within the [Card](../data-models/card) data model.  
>
> - **Scryfall:** `https://api.scryfall.com/cards/${scryfallId}?format=image`
> - **Gatherer:** `https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=${multiverseId}`
>
> - **Notes:**  
> Gatherer may not have all images. If a `multiverseId` is missing, the imagery will not exist there.  
> For Scryfall, to access another face of a card, such as for transform or meld cards, add `&face=front` or `&face=back` to the url to get the respective image.

> ### How do I find the other card faces of "Meld" cards?
> The most effective way to get the other cards for "Meld" cards is to access the `otherFaceIds` property of any of the "Meld" cards. This property will return two `uuid` values for the other associated cards.
>
> Depending on your use case, this can be enough data to get the information you need, otherwise you can use those cards to access their `otherFaceIds` to get the card you need by comparing the data that you have already.

> ### What information is in AtomicCards?
> [AtomicCards](/downloads/all-files/#atomiccards) only contains oracle information for each card. Any data that is persistent across the printings of a card will be included, such as `convertedManaCost`, but anything that pertains to a specific printing of a card will **NOT** be included, such as `artist`.
>
> For a full list of properties, see the [Card (Atomic)](/data-models/card-atomic/) data model documentation. Note that depending on your use case you probably do not need this file, as it can be easily derived from [AllPrintings](/downloads/all-files/#allprintings) - handle with care.

> ### Why is the file I just downloaded out of date?
> You have probably received a cached version of the file. Try hard-refreshing the website (`CTRL + F5` on Windows, `Shift + Command + R` on Mac) and re-downloading to get the newest version.

> ### Why is the website out of date or giving me errors?
> You have probably received a cached version of the website or your browser is not supported. Update to the latest version of your internet browser or try hard-refreshing the website (`CTRL + F5` on Windows, `Shift + Command + R` on Mac) and try the action again.
