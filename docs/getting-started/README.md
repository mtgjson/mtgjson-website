# Getting Started

MTGJSON provides [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) data for your applications in various file formats.

[[toc]]

## Files

### Formats

Formats are provided via a file server and not a true API. JSON can be fetched in your code but many of the files are extremely large in size so it is not recommended to open links in your browser.

- **JSON**
- **CSV**
- **SQL/SQLite**
- **Compressed files**

### Downloads

For a full list of files see the [Downloads](/downloads/) page.

## Models

### Data Models

Data Models are what we call the structures that contain data inside files and other Data Models. They vary in their availability and are based heavily on the type of file accessed and the Data Models in those files. Some of the base-level Data Models used in the files are:

- [Card (Atomic)](/data-models/card-atomic/): Data inside `AtomicCards.json` and `<Format>Atomic.json`.
- [Card (Set)](/data-models/card-set/): Data inside `AllIdentifiers.json`.
- [Set](/data-models/set/): Data inside `AllPrintings.json` and `<Format>.json`.

### Abstract Models

Abstract models are what we call the structures that contain more complex data inside files. They tend to have many nested properties and thus documentation is formalized with example responses and structures. Some of the base-level models used in files are:

- [All Prices](/abstract-models/all-prices/): Data inside `AllPrices.json`.
- [Booster](/abstract-models/booster/): Data inside [Set](/data-models/set/#booster) `booster` property.
- [Enum Values](/abstract-models/enum-values/): Data inside `EnumValues.json`.

## GraphQL API

### MTGGraphQL

A sub-service of MTGJSON, [MTGGraphQL](/mtggraphql/) is a GraphQL API and Server built on top of the MTGJSON data sets.
