    //- p As of MTGJSON5, and going forward, web-served files will be available via a version specific "Web API" path: <code>/api/v5/*</code>. If your project depends on the web-served files please update your project to the new API as soon as possible. During the transition to v5, all v4 API routes are still available at: <code>/files/*</code>. For more information, see the <a href="/changelog/version-5/">Changelog</a>.
    //- ul
    //-   li We now offer file verification with SHA-256. Every file has a SHA-256 file available at the same API location with an appended <code>.sha256</code> format. For example: <code>https://mtgjson.com/api/v5/AllPrintings.json.sha256</code>.
