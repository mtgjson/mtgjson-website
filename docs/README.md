# MTGJSON

## Our Mission

MTGJSON is an open-source project that catalogs all Magic: The Gathering cards in a portable format. A dedicated group of fans maintains and supplies data for a variety of projects and sites in the community.

<strong>New JSON builds happen every Sunday at 4PM EST, though subject to change, and may take several hours to compile.</strong>
