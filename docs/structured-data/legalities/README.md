# Legalities (Play Formats)

List of play formats that are legal for a specific card.

> Parent structure: [card](../card)  
> Parent property: `legalities`  
> Parent property type: `array(object)`  
> Property values: `Legal`, `Restricted`, `Banned`, or `Future`  

`Future` is used for a revision of the format in which the card will be legal soon. If the format is not listed, it is assumed the card is not legal in that format.)
