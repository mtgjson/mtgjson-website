# Booster

A Booster is a data structure with containing property values of Booster configurations, and is not a Data Model itself.

- **Parent model:** [Set](/data-models/set/)

## Booster Configurations

### Overview

The actual Booster data is accessed through a property key that defines the [Booster Config](/data-models/booster/booster-config/). What this property key name is depends on the Set that contains this Data Model and all of its booster variations for that Set.
