# Data Models

Data Models in MTGJSON describe any JSON object or nested JSON object that provides a flat response. As such, they will only have one level of nested keys. Any additional nested keys that return another object that is also a flat response are they themselves, a Data Model, and will have its own documentation.

For example, any <strong>Data Model</strong> would look similar to this:

```json
"<Parent Property>": {
  "<Some Property>": <Array, Boolean, Float, Integer, Object, String>,
  ...
}
```

Most data output by MTGJSON are Data Models but some models have more complex models which are outlined as [Abstract Models](/abstract-models/).
