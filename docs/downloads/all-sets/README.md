# All Sets

All individual set files to download provided by MTGJSON.

::: warning
As of MTGJSON version 5, and going forward, web-served files will be available via a version specific "Web API" path: `/api/v5/files/*`. If your project depends on the web-served files please update your project to the new API as soon as possible.
</br>
</br>
Legacy files for version 4 are still available during transition at `/json/*` or `/files/*` (both serve the same files).
