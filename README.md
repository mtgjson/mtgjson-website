## Notes

### Landcycle

Landcycle is a JS class that allows JSON to take mustache variables such as `{{link:variable}}` (creating an internal link), `{{external:display-text$url}}` (creating an external link) and `{{code:variable}}` (creating an inline-code style) and then intercepts the JSON in Vue to hydrate the data in to data of your choosing. On the website we use this to change data structures in to anchor tags that link to other documentation while maintaining our SPA.
